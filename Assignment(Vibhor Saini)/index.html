    <h3>Q.4  Difference btw Var , Let and const</h3>
    <p> <span><h2>Var</h2></span>
        1.var: Var has function scope. If a variable is declared inside a function using var,
         it is only accessible within that function. 
         <br>
        2.var: Hoists the variable declaration to the top of its scope, but the initialization remains in its original position.
         This means you can use the variable before it is declared without causing an error.
        <br>
        3.var allow reassignment. You can change the value of a variable declared with var.
        <br>
        4.When declared outside any function, becomes a property of the global object.
        (e.g., window in a browser environment).</p>

        <p> <span><h2>let and const</h2></span> 
            1.let and const: Have block scope. 
            They are limited to the block in which they are defined, such as loops or if statements.
            <br>
            2.let and const: Also hoist, but unlike var, they are not initialized until the interpreter reaches the actual declaration in the code.
            Trying to use the variable before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.
            <br>
            3. let allow reassignment. You can change the value of a variable declared with let. but const Does not allow reassignment after initialization.
             Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be changed.
             <br>
             4. let and const: Do not become properties of the global object when declared outside any function.
